# Hornet RISC-V Core
Hornet is a simple, fully open-source, FPGA-proven 32-bit RISC-V core.

## Highlights
* RV32I instructions
* Machine mode support
* 5-stage pipelined microarchitecture
* Misaligned access support
* FPGA proven

In this repo, in addition to the core itself, you can also find supporting peripherals, software and SoC examples to help you get started.

We also provide a reference manual that explains how the core is designed and how it works, in detail; and a user manual that describes how
you can use the core. (To be added soon...)
